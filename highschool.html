<marquee behavior=alternate><h2> My High school days </h2></marquee>
I am now at my high school years, this is where I enjoyed better than my grade school years. There's a lot of events that I've experienced in this year and I totally had a blast with my high school friends. We went into different places to have lots of fun, and of course we did not let our grades fail even though we're having fun together.  <br/>
